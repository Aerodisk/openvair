"""Module defining RPC queue names for various services.

This module contains the RPCQueueNames class, which serves as a centralized
repository for RPC queue names used across different services in the system.
Each nested class within RPCQueueNames represents a specific service or module
and contains constants for the corresponding service layer and domain layer
queue names.

The queue names are organized hierarchically, allowing for easy access and
management of RPC communication channels between different parts of the system.

Classes:
    RPCQueueNames: Main class containing nested classes for different modules.
        Each nested class has its own docstring describing its specific purpose.
