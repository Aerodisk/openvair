"""Background task management framework.

This module provides a framework for managing background tasks that run
periodically in a separate thread. It includes classes for defining and
managing these tasks, handling graceful shutdowns, and supporting
decorators for periodic tasks.

Classes:
    ServiceExitError: Custom exception used to signal service shutdown.
    Task: A thread-based task that executes periodically.
    MetaBackgroundTasks: Metaclass that automatically registers periodic
        tasks.
    BackgroundTasks: Base class that manages background tasks, including
        starting, stopping, and handling shutdowns.

Functions:
    service_shutdown: Signal handler function to initiate service shutdown.
    periodic_task: Decorator to mark a method as a periodic task with a
        specified interval.
