"""Module for managing Fibre Channel (FC) device connections.

This module provides the `FibreChannelInterface` class, which is responsible for
managing Fibre Channel device connections, including the ability to perform a
LIP (Loop Initialization Procedure) scan.

The class inherits from the `BaseFibreChannel` abstract base class, which
defines the common interface for Fibre Channel block device interfaces.

The module also includes a custom exception, `LipScanError`, which is used to
handle any errors that may occur during the LIP scan process.

Classes:
    FibreChannelInterface: Provides functionality to manage Fibre Channel
        devices.
