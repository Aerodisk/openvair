"""Module for providing abstract base classes for block device interfaces.

This module defines two abstract base classes: `BaseBlockInterface` and
`BaseFibreChannelInterface`. These classes provide a common interface for
interacting with different types of block device interfaces, such as ISCSI
and Fibre Channel.

Classes:
    BaseBlockInterface: Abstract base class for block device interfaces.
    BaseFibreChannelInterface: Abstract base class for Fibre Channel interfaces.
    BaseISCSI: Abstract base class for ISCSI interfaces.
    BaseFibreChannel: Abstract base class for Fibre Channel interfaces that
        inherits from `BaseFibreChannelInterface`.
