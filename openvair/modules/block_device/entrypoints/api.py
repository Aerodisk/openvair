"""Module providing API endpoints for managing block device interfaces.

This module defines several API endpoints for managing block device interfaces,
such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. The endpoints allow users to perform various
operations, including retrieving sessions, getting the host IQN, logging in and
out of iSCSI targets, and performing a LIP (Loop Initialization Procedure)
scan on Fibre Channel host adapters.

The module uses the FastAPI framework to define the API routes and handle the
requests. It also utilizes the `InterfaceCrud` class from the
`openvair.modules.block_device.entrypoints.crud` module to perform the
necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the block device
interfaces.

The module includes several Pydantic data models defined in the
`openvair.modules.block_device.entrypoints.schemas` module, which are used to
represent the various types of block device interfaces and their associated
data.

Routes:
    /block-devices/sessions: Retrieve sessions associated with block devices.
    /block-devices/get-iqn: Get the IQN associated with the current host.
    /block-devices/login: Log in to the specified iSCSI target.
    /block-devices/logout: Log out from the specified iSCSI target.
    /block-devices/lip_scan: Perform a LIP scan on Fibre Channel host adapters.
