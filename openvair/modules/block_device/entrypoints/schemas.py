"""Module defining data models for block device interfaces.

This module provides Pydantic data models for representing different types of
block device interfaces, including general interface information, login
status, and IQN data.

Classes:
    Interface: Represents general information about a block device interface.
    InterfaceLogin: Represents a block device interface with login status.
    InterfaceDeleted: Represents a block device interface that has been deleted.
    IQN: Represents an IQN (iSCSI Qualified Name).
