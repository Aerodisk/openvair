"""Module for providing CRUD operations on block device interfaces.

This module defines the `InterfaceCrud` class, which is responsible for
handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on block device
interfaces, such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel. The class uses the `Protocol`
class from the `openvair.libs.messaging.protocol` module to communicate with
the service layer and perform the requested operations.

The module includes methods for getting all iSCSI sessions, getting the current
host IQN, logging in and out of iSCSI block devices, and performing a LIP
(Loop Initialization Procedure) scan on Fibre Channel host adapters.

Classes:
    InterfaceCrud: Provides CRUD operations on block device interfaces.
