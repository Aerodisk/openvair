"""Module for managing the Volume Service Layer.

This module defines the `VolumeServiceLayerManagerInterface`, which serves as
the contract for handling volume-related operations in the service layer.
Any class implementing this interface is responsible for interacting with the
domain layer and the event store to perform various tasks, such as retrieving
volume information, creating, extending, deleting, and attaching volumes.

Classes:
    VolumeServiceLayerManagerInterface: Interface for handling volume service
        layer operations.
